# Project Title
 Design and creation of a cryptocurrency

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Acknowledgments
The code in the Cryptocurrency package was based on David Katz's blockchain-based cryptocurrency lecture and part of his source code.(https://github.com/15Dkatz/cryptochain)

### Prerequisites
To get started with the example, you'll need recent version of node.js and npm.

```
node - v
```
Update to the latest version using
```
npm i -g npm.
```
If you do not have Node.js installed, Go to nodejs.org. You'll see download links for your laptop.

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
Clone repository:url
cd /ProjectFolder
npm install
```
### Use the cryptocurrency application
Start our root node and peer node

```
npm start dev
npm start dev-peer
```

## Running the tests
```
npm run test
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system. First, login to heroku website and create the application on the server.
```
heroku login
heroku create
```

Add Redis service on our app
```
heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev -a YourAppName
```

To check creation progress
```
heroku addons:info redisAppName
```

To view documentation
```
heroku addons:docs heroku-redis
```

Find the Redis services address on the server
```
heroku config | grep REDIS
```

Push all the file to the server
```
git add -A
git commit -m "Information you want to record"
git push heroku master
```

Check logs whether the deployment is successful
```
heroku logs --tail
```
