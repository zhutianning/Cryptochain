## ‚ù§Ô∏èüëãüíµDesign and create a cryptocurrency

You can start with this or create your own from scratch.

To get started with the  example, you'll need recent version of node.js and npm. Fork this repository to your own github account so you can share your work.

```
cd Cryptochain
npm install
npm start dev
npm start dev-peer
```

### Blockchain

### Proof of Work

### API

### Network

This example requires Redis Pub/Sub support,

The [Redis page](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) is a good place to start learning about the Redis Publish/Subscribe messaging system.

### Transactions ,Keys , Wallet

Created the core wallet class for the cryptocurrency.

Developed the cryptographic key pair and public key addressing system.

Implementing signature generation and verification to make transactions official.

Built the main transaction class - with the output map and input structure.

Developed functionality to actually validate transactions.

Tied transaction creation with the wallet class.

Allowed transactions to be updated with multiple outputs to efficiently use existing objects.

Improved the hash function to recognize objects with new properties as changes in incoming data.

Covered edges cases with transaction updates to prevent vulnerabilities.

## Frontend Blockchain

React.js web application framework

## Ideas to try

Here are a few ideas for you to try:

#### Change the network


#### Change the transaction speed


#### Spice up the front-end design


#### Add visualizations

Analyze the transaction data ...

#### Use a different programming language

Most languages and platforms out there can implement this project...

#### Connect to other devices
